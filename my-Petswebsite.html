            <p>The dog is a pet animal.
             A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily,
             it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth, 
            and a nose. It is a very clever animal and is very 
            useful in catching thieves. It runs very fast, 
            barks loudly and attacks the strangers.</p>
            <p>Breeds: There are approximately 400 separate breeds of purebred dogs worldwide,
                I will only talk about three to four breeds </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bulldogs</li>
                    <p>Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a thick-set,
                        low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose 'sourmug'
                        face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity
                        These docile, loyal companions adapt well to town or country.
                        You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, 
                        furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with
                        hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive 
                        rolling gait all practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!
                    </p>
                    <li>Poodle</li>
                    <p>The Poodle, called the Pudel in 
                        German and the Caniche in French, is a breed of water dog.
                        he breed is divided into four varieties based on size, 
                        the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle,
                        Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 
                        10 to 18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.
                     </p>
                    <li>Pharaoh hound</li>
                    <p>The Pharaoh Hound, ancient "Blushing Dog" of Malta, is an elegant but rugged sprinting hound bred to course small game over punishing terrain. Quick and 
                    tenacious on scent, these friendly, affectionate hounds settle down nicely at home.
                    </p>
                    <li>Doberman</li>
                    <p>Doberman Pinschers, a breed that originated in Germany during 
                    the late 19th century, have a fascinating history deeply 
                    intertwined with their role as loyal and reliable guard dogs.</p>
