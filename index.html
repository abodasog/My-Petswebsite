                    <p>Rabbits are <strong>tiny and furry</strong> animals popularly known as bunnies.
                        <strong>Rabbits</strong> belong to the <em>Lagomorpha</em> order.
                        Rabbits can move their eyes 360 degrees.

                        Their body is covered in thick and soft fur, making them look adorable.
                        rabbits are smaller and have shorter ears than hares. They are born without fur and 
                        with closed eyes after a gestation period of 30 to 31 days. They 
                        prefer habitats composed of trees and shrubs, where they live in burrows dug into the soil. Hares, 
                        in contrast, are larger in size, and they are born fully developed with fur and 
                        open eyes after a gestation period lasting about 42 days. </p>
